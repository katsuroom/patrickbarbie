BEFORE MERGING TO MAIN:
git checkout main --> go to main
git pull --> get most remote changes for main
git checkout [your branch] --> go to your branch
git merge main --> merge main into your branch
if you have merge conflicts fix them...
create pull request on github
get someone else to look over it
and merge
